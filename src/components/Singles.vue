        <h3>Some relevant information:</h3>
        <h3>1. As a single person in Singapore, you have two choices for HDB housing. You can either apply for a 2-room Flexi BTO (built-to-order) flat from HDB in a non-mature estate or buy a resale HDB flat. However, in both cases, you must wait till you are 35 years old (unless you are widowed or orphaned).</h3>
        <h3>2. If you are aged 55 and above and are looking to buy a short-lease 2-room Flexi flat, or aged 65 and above and are looking to buy a Community Care Apartment (CCA), please refer to the section on seniors.</h3>
