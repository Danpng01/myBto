            <p>A household’s eligibility for housing subsidies and HDB housing loan is assessed based on the core family nucleus, which is formed by the applicant(s) and occupier(s) who enable the household to meet the eligibility conditions for the flat purchase. They must remain in the flat application, as well as during the minimum occupation period (MOP) after the flat purchase.</p>
            <p>For BTO flats, you are limited to applying for 2-room Flexi flats in non-mature estates. However, from the second half of 2024 onwards, singles will qualify for 2-room Flexi flats across all locations.</p>
            <p>If you are aged 55 and above and are looking to buy a short-lease 2-room Flexi flat, or aged 65 and above and are looking to buy a Community Care Apartment (CCA), please refer to the section on seniors.</p>
            <p style = "margin-bottom: 20px">If you intend to buy resale flats, you can buy all flat types in any location (except for 3Gen flats). To qualify for the HDB Single Scheme, you’ll need to be:</p>
